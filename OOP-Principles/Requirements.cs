     Lab 07:

    Create a minimum of 2 interfaces.
    Each interface created should be implemented by more than one class.
    Have at least one class implement more than one interface
    Test your code with Unit testing
    Label interfaces as <interface>
    Do not implement your interfaces on your highest base class. The interfaces should be scattered among the application.

    When running your application, it should output each of the concrete animals and one behavior that it has inherited without any direct code manipulation
